    <!-- Task 2: Building a Simple Card with a Title and Text
1.	How would you create a Bootstrap card with a title and some text content inside?
2.	Which classes can you use to add padding inside the card so the text doesnâ€™t touch the edges?
3.	How would you add a shadow to the card using Bootstrap utility classes, and which class could you use to add some margin around the card?
